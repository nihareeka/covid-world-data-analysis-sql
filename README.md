# COVID Data Analysis Project in SQL

This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing global COVID-19 death and vaccination data using the `coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations` tables.

## Key Queries

1. Basic Data Retrieval:
   - Retrieve data from `coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations` tables.

2. Total Cases vs Total Deaths in the United States:
   - Analyze likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in the United States.

3. Total Cases vs Population:
   - Determine the percentage of population that contracted COVID-19.

4. Highest Infection Rates:
   - Identify countries with the highest infection rates compared to population.

5. Highest Death Counts:
   - Identify countries and continents with the highest death counts.

6. Global COVID-19 Data:
   - Analyze global data, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.

7. Vaccination Progress:
   - Combine `coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations` data to analyze vaccination progress.

8. Temporary Table and View:
   - Create a temporary table (`percent_population_vaccinated`) and a view (`percent_population_vaccinated_view`) for data storage.
